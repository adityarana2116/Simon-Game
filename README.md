# Simon-Game

The game consists of four colored buttons, red, blue, green, and yellow. Each of these buttons emits a unique sound when pressed.

Here's how the game works: 
The game starts by lighting up one of the buttons and playing a corresponding sound. This is the first "step" in the sequence.
After the first step, the player needs to repeat the sequence shown by pressing the buttons in the same order. For example, if the game lights up the blue button first, the player must press the blue button. Then, if the game adds the green button in the next step, the player needs to press the blue button first and then the green button.
